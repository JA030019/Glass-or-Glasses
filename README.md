# glass-or-glasses

The goal of this project is to implement a convolution neural network to determine whether the person in a portrait image is wearing glass or not. The whole procedure includes extracting feature values and labels from the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset, formalizing the pictures, data partition, model training and the final accuracy test. In our final test, the  accuracy is 92%.
